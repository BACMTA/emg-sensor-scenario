## Brief
"You have been approached by a company who wants to build a simple device controlled by a muscle activity sensor. There is no specific requirement which muscle group you should use for your control signals. It could be either the biceps muscle (when you flex your arms), finger muscles (when you type), masseter (when you clench your teeth) or any other muscles which present an electromyogram (EMG) signal when being activated. You will work in groups and have up to one week to deliver the device. The output of your device should indicate, using either an audio, visual, and/or motion, the movement and strength of the muscle activities."
